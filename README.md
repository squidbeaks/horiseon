# Code Refactor of Horiseon Site

The following is a link to the refactored and deployed Horiseon site:
https://squidbeaks.github.io/horiseon

The refactor focused on updating code to follow best practices regarding accessibility and more modern HTML conventions, such as using semantic elements, as opposed to more generic. This refactor should also improve the SEO of this website. There were also other opportunities for optimization, such as consolidating style code that was being reused across the site itself. Some id's and classes were updating to following best-practice naming conventions.

For reference, here is a screenshot that lays out what the application should look like:
